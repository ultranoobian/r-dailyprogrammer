Title case)
Text:  Write a function that transforms a string into [title case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Headings_and_publication_titles). This mostly means: capitalizing only every first letter of every word in the string. However, there are some non-obvious exceptions to title case which can't easily be hard-coded. Your function must accept, as a second argument, a set or list of words that should **not** be capitalized. Furthermore, the **first word** of every title should always have a capital leter. For example:

    exceptions = ['jumps', 'the', 'over']
    titlecase('the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', exceptions)

This should return:

    The Quick Brown Fox jumps over the Lazy Dog

An example from the Wikipedia page:

    exceptions = ['are', 'is', 'in', 'your', 'my']
    titlecase('THE vitamins ARE IN my fresh CALIFORNIA raisins', exceptions)

Returns:

    The Vitamins are in my Fresh California Raisins
