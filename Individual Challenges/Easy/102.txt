Title:  [10/13/2012] Challenge #103 [easy-difficult] (Text transformations)
Text:  ###Easy

Back in the 90s (and early 00s) people thought it was a cool idea to \\/\\/|2][73 |_1|<3 7H15 to bypass text filters on BBSes. They called it [Leet (or 1337)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet), and it quickly became popular all over the internet. The habit has died out, but it's still quite interesting to see the various replacements people came up with when transforming characters.

Your job's to write a program that translates normal text into Leet, either by hardcoding a number of translations (e.g. A becomes either 4 or /-\\, randomly) or allowing the user to specify a random translation table as an input file, like this:

    A    4 /-\
    B    |3 [3 8
    C    ( {
    (etc.)

Each line in the table contains a single character, followed by whitespace, followed by a space-separated list of possible replacements. Characters should have some non-zero chance of not being replaced at all.
