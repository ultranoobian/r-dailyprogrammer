Title:  [10/25/2012] Challenge #107 [Easy] (All possible decodings)
Text:  Consider the translation from letters to numbers `a -> 1` through `z -> 26`. Every sequence of letters can be translated into a string of numbers this way, with the numbers being mushed together. For instance `hello -> 85121215`. Unfortunately the reverse translation is not unique. `85121215` could map to `hello`, but also to `heaubo`. Write a program that, given a string of digits, outputs every possible translation back to letters.

Sample input:

`  123`

Sample output:

`  abc`

`  aw`

`  lc`
