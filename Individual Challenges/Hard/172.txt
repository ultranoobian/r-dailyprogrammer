Title:  [3/22/2012] Challenge #29 [difficult]
Text:  Draw a line... except it must be your implementation of a line using only the ability to draw a point.  Think implementing a line is too easy?  Try it :).  You can output the result in ASCII text if you'd like instead of using a graphics library.  A successful implementation will be able to draw [this](http://imgur.com/a8LuR).  Only being able to draw horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines is not enough, and the lines can't contain any holes.  Also, if you're drawing a line (I'll use drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2) as an example) using the following call:  drawLine(100, 10, 200, 300), then the following call must draw the same line:  drawLine(200, 300, 100, 10).
