Title:  [8/24/2012] Challenge #91 [difficult] (Chess move validation)
Text:  [Forsyth-Edwards notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) is a is a notation used by chess players for describing a particular board position of a chess game. It contains information about the pieces, whose turn it is, who can castle, and how many turns have passed, among others. Write a program that reads a FEN file and two coordinates from input, like this:

    rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
    e2 e4

Your program parses the FEN board, then determines whether moving the piece on coordinate 1 to coordinate 2 is a valid move, printing either `true` or `false`. As demonstrated here, it is:
