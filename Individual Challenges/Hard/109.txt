Title:  [8/27/2012] Challenge #92 [difficult] (Bags and balls)
Text:  Compute all the permutations of placing 9 balls into 4 bags such that each bag contains an odd number of balls.

Ball count is transient when placing bags within one another. For example, a bag containing 3 balls is placed inside a bag containing 2 balls. The inner bag contains 3 balls and the outer bag contains 5 balls.

Some example permutations:

    ((((9))))
    (8(((1))))
    (1)(1)((7))
