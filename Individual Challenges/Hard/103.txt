Title:  [9/15/2012] Challenge #98 [difficult] (Reading digital displays)
Text:  [Challenge #92 [easy]](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/ywlvf/8272012_challenge_92_easy_digital_number_display/) involved converting a number to a seven segment display representation (of a variable size) using +, -, and |. Assume the font looks like this:

       + +--+ +--+ +  + +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+ 
       |    |    | |  | |    |       | |  | |  | |  | 
       |    |    | |  | |    |       | |  | |  | |  | 
       + +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+    + +--+ +--+ +  + 
       | |       |    |    | |  |    | |  |    | |  | 
       | |       |    |    | |  |    | |  |    | |  | 
       + +--+ +--+    + +--+ +--+    + +--+ +--+ +--+

Write a program that reads such a string and converts it back into a number. (You'll have to deduce the size yourself.) The output for the above text would be `1234567890`.

As a bonus, have your program be able to read a file containing characters of different sizes, like this:

    +-+ +  + +-+
      | |  | |
    +-+ |  | +-+
      | +--+   |
    +-+    | +-+
           |
           +
