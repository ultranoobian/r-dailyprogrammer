Title:  [9/01/2012] Challenge #94 [difficult] (Simple Lisp interpreter)
Text:  Lisp is a family of programming languages, known for its extremely simple notation (called S-expressions) in which programs are defined as lists and code can be modified as data. Your task is to write an interpreter for a simple subset of Lisp.

Peter Norvig wrote a [popular article on how to write a simple Lisp interpreter](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) in only 90 lines of Python. You can choose to port his code to a language of your choice, or write one on your own, from scratch. Bonus points for solving today's easy challenge (or maybe even *this* challenge) in your own Lisp dialect!
