Title:  [2015-08-12] Challenge #227 [Intermediate] Contiguous chains
Text:  #Description:

If something is contiguous, it means it is connected or unbroken. For a chain, this would mean that all parts of the chain are reachable without leaving the chain. So, in this little piece of ASCII-art:    
    
    xxxxxxxx  
    x      x

there is only 1 contiguous chain, while in this
    
    xxxx xxxx 
    
    x
there are 3 contiguous chains. Note that a single x, unconnected to any other, counts as one chain. 

For the purposes of this problems, chains can only be contiguous if they connect horizontally of vertically, not diagonally. So this image
    
    xx
      xx
        xx    

contains three chains.

Your challenge today is to write a program that calculates the number of contiguous chains in a given input.  

#Formal inputs &amp; outputs
##Input:

The first line in the input will consist of two numbers separated by a space, giving the dimensions of the ASCII-field you're supposed to read. The first number gives the number of lines to read, the second the number of columns (all lines have the same number of columns).

After that follows the field itself, consisting of only x's and spaces. 

##Output:

Output a single number giving the number of contiguous chains. 

#Sample inputs &amp; outputs

#Challenge inputs:

    xx x xx x  
    x  x xx x  
    xx   xx  x 
    xxxxxxxxx x
             xx
    xxxxxxxxxxx
     x x x x x 
      x x x x  

#Bonus
/u/Cephian was nice enough to generete [a much larger 1000x1000 input](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Cephian/f1c2869bd67d40c88042/raw/63871d115bc7bf887eac5434b5c6c5494f83ba2e/10.txt) which you are welcome to use if you want a little tougher performance test.
