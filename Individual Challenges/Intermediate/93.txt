Title:  [9/01/2012] Challenge #94 [intermediate] (Base64 conversion)
Text:  Create a function which accepts a byte array and outputs a [Base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) equivalent of the parameter. Write a second function that reverses the progress, decoding a Base64 string.

Obviously, you can't use a library function for the encode/decode.
